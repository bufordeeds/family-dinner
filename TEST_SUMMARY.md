## 🎯 Test Categories Implemented

### ✅ Framework Validation Tests
- Jest configuration working correctly
- Environment variables properly mocked
- DOM testing utilities available
- Faker.js data generation working

### ✅ Mock Data Generation Tests  
- User creation (chefs and attendees)
- Event creation with business rules
- Location data generation
- Reservation workflows (authenticated & guest)

### ✅ Service Integration Tests
- EventService mocking capabilities
- Error handling simulation
- Multiple mock configurations
- Mock reset between tests

### ✅ Business Logic Simulation Tests
- Event creation workflow validation
- Reservation capacity checking
- Guest reservation handling
- Email notification tracking
- Data validation constraints
- Performance testing simulation

## 🚀 Ready for Implementation

The test framework is now **production-ready** and can support:

### API Endpoint Testing
- All CRUD operations for events
- Reservation system workflows  
- Authentication and authorization
- Error scenarios and edge cases

### Business Logic Testing
- Event validation rules
- Capacity management
- Email notifications
- Guest user flows
- Waitlist management

### Integration Testing
- Database operations (mocked)
- External service calls (mocked)
- Email service integration
- File upload handling

## 📊 Coverage Reporting

Coverage reports are configured with:
- **HTML reports** in `coverage/` directory
- **Terminal summary** during test runs
- **CI integration** ready
- **80% minimum thresholds** set for production code

## 🎉 Next Steps

1. **Start writing real API tests** - Framework is ready
2. **Add component tests** - React Testing Library setup complete
3. **Implement E2E tests** - Foundation established
4. **CI/CD integration** - Test scripts configured

The comprehensive test suite foundation is now in place and all tests are passing successfully! 🎊
